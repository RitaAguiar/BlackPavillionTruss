# BlackPavillionTruss
A truss dimensioned for the Black Pavillion, located in Lisbon. This case study was developed in Racket with the Rosetta tool and generated in AutoCAD, Rhinoceros and Robot Structural Analysis.

The case study selected is a parallelepiped service building with two levels, located in an urban context, to function as a museum. The architects wanted to create an articulated truss type structure to support the entire span of the coverage slab of the building. It was desired that the height dimension of the truss solution adopted would be the less possible depth.

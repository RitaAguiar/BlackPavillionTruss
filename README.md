# BlackPavillionTruss
3D Model of the Black Pavillion Truss - A truss dimensioned for the Black Pavillion, located in Lisbon and developed in Racket using the Rosetta tool in DrRacket, generated and rendered in AutoCAD and Rhinceros and analyzed in Robot Structural Analysis.

The case study selected is a parallelepiped service building with two levels, located in an urban context, to function as a museum. The architects wanted to create an articulated truss type structure to support the entire span of the coverage slab of the building. It was desired that the height dimension of the truss solution adopted would be the less possible depth.
